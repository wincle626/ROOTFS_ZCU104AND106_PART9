% Run securely.  z2 disables both shell command execution in
% `\special' and config files (via the `E' option) and opening of any
% absolute filenames.  z1, the default, forbids shell escapes but
% allows absolute filenames.  z0 allows both.  The corresponding
% command line options are -R0|-R1|-R2
z1

% How to print, maybe with lp instead lpr, etc. If commented-out, output
% will go into a file by default.

% Metafont mode.  (This is completely different from the -M
% command-line option, which controls whether mktexpk is invoked.)
% See ../../metafont/misc/modes.mf for a list of mode names.  This mode
% and the D number above must agree, or mktexpk will get confused.
M ljfour

% Last resort bitmap sizes.
R 300 600

% Correct printer offset. You can use testpage.tex from the LaTeX
% distribution to find these numbers.
O 0pt,0pt

% Bitmap font compression. Results in more compact output files, but
% sometimes causes trouble. So the default is disabled. Set Z1 to enable
% this feature.
Z0

% Partially download Type 1 fonts by default.  Only reason not to do
% this is if you encounter bugs.  (Please report them to
% @email{tex-k@tug.org} if you do.)

% In the past, the a4size and letterSize definitions did not set the
% paper size, but we want to set it if we can so that ps2pdf can work
% properly.  So, a4 and a4size, and letter and letterSize, are made
% identical here, and we prefer the a4/letter names -- texconfig uses them.
%
% In the definitions below, if we have setpagedevice, use that.
% Else if we have the a4 resp. letter operator, use that.
% Else do nothing to set the page size.
% 
% If you need to have no paper size stuff in the output at all, e.g., if
% you are producing a multi-page document for further processing, use
% -tnopaper (defined at end).  (With a single-page document, you can use -E.)

% use -t nopaper to get no paper size stuff in the output at all.
% This should remain as the last thing in the file, because the first
% 0in 0in entry is chosen when there is nothing better; ordinarily, we
% want to that to be "unknown", so that the correct nonstandard paper
% size is output, instead of just being omitted.
