Master/texmf-dist/scripts/texlive
(This file is public domain.)

This directory contains scripts for TeX Live. Unlike everything else
under Master/texmf-dist/scripts, except scripts/texlive-extra, most of
these scripts are actually maintained here, and not under Build.

There are slave copies of these Master-maintained scripts in
Build/source/texk/texlive/linked_scripts, just as for the multitude of
scripts updated from CTAN.

The man pages for the programs here, though, are still maintained in
Build/, since that is almost 100% true in TL, and it seems better not to
break that.

Additional scripts maintained as part of TeX Live, but not important for
infrastructure or installation, are in ../texlive-extra.

One reason for doing this is so we can have $Id expansion, so
svn:keywords is set for the scripts maintained here. When they were
maintained in Build, the --version option and doc of the copies in bin/
svn->git mirror process does not preserve $Id strings. (Note from Karl:
Although many people and processes hate keyword expansion, I'm afraid
that I find it quite useful, so I don't want to give it up as long as I
am working here. Feel free to change it after I'm gone. :)

Another reason is that almost all scripts in the bin/*/ directories are
now symlinks into texmf-dist/scripts/, so it's nice for these to follow
suit for consistency and clarity.

Summary of packages maintained as part of TeX Live,
and whether they are included in scheme-infraonly:
----------------------------------------------------
texlive.infra - infraonly, core (tlmgr and support),
  changes only pushed as a critical update.
kpathsea - infraonly, binaries (kpsewhich) and non-user-visible scripts,
  binaries only rebuilt for the annual release.
texlive-scripts - infraonly, important scripts (fmtutil, updmap,
  mktexlsr, ...), changes pushed normally.
texlive-scripts-extra - not infraonly, little-used scripts (allcm, allec,
  texconfig, ...), changes pushed normally.

The principal mailing list is http://lists.tug.org/tex-live.

All of these scripts are free software, mostly public domain.
